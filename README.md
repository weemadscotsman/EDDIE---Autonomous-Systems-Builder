EDDIE
Autonomous Systems Builder

I build systems that don’t need supervision, don’t lie about their state, and don’t fall apart the second someone does something stupid.

I’m not a “visionary”.
I don’t “disrupt”.
I don’t pitch ideas I haven’t already built at least three times.

If it exists here, it ran.
If it ran, it broke.
If it broke, it taught me something.

🧠 What I Actually Do

I design and build:

Autonomous reasoning systems

Self-observing AI architectures

Trading and execution engines

Governance and economic systems

Dashboards that expose uncomfortable truths

Tools that assume misuse, failure, and interference by default

I’m interested in systems that survive reality, not demos that survive screenshots.

🧭 Operating Principles

No ghost state
If something happens, it emits telemetry. Silence is a bug.

Kill switches everywhere
Anything autonomous must be stoppable instantly. No exceptions.

Local-first when possible
Cloud is a convenience, not a dependency.

If I can’t inspect it, I don’t trust it
This applies to code, models, markets, and people.

History beats hype
Git logs > launch tweets.

🛠 How I Work

I think by building, not by whiteboarding

I fork instead of “iterating safely”

I leave artifacts, not explanations

I optimise for coherence, not speed

I stop when a system becomes boring (that’s usually when it’s stable)

I don’t chase “finished”.
I chase structurally sound.

⚠️ Things I’m Bad At (On Purpose)

Marketing

Simplifying early

Pretending something works when it doesn’t

Playing nice with tools that hide their behaviour

Maintaining one project when three better questions appear

If that’s a problem, this page already did its job.

🧾 What This Page Is

This is not a portfolio.
This is not a pitch.
This is not a brand.

It’s a boundary.

If you understand what’s here, we’ll get on.
If you don’t, that’s fine too.

Busy. Building. Logging history.
No mock data. No theatre. No permission cycles.
